SCU Undergraduate Students Interested in Summer Research
-----
SCU offers funding opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in summer research programs.
Please note that most funding applications for summer research are due in February during the Winter Quarter.
To determine your eligibility for these opportunities, visit the following pages:
* [Single Portal for Undergraduate Research](https://www.scu.edu/provost/research/student-funding-opportunities/scuspur/)
* [Kuehler Undergraduate Research](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/labs--research/research/kuehler-undergraduate-research/)
If you are eligible, I encourage you to contact me to discuss your interest in summer research at least two weeks before the application deadline.
Please keep in mind that there is typically a limit on the number of proposals each faculty member can submit.
Therefore, I will have to screen applicants based on their motivation and the specificity of their research ideas.
