SCU Undergraduate Students Interested in Summer Research
-----
SCU offers funding opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in summer research programs.
Please note that most funding applications for summer research are due in February during the Winter Quarter.
To determine your eligibility for these opportunities, visit the following pages:
* [Single Portal for Undergraduate Research](https://www.scu.edu/provost/research/student-funding-opportunities/scuspur/)
* [Kuehler Undergraduate Research](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/labs--research/research/kuehler-undergraduate-research/)

If you are eligible, I encourage you to contact me to discuss your interest in summer research at least two weeks before the application deadline.
Please keep in mind that there is typically a limit on the number of proposals each faculty member can submit.
Therefore, I will have to screen applicants based on their motivation and the specificity of their research ideas.



SCU Master’s Students Seeking Advice on Program of Study
-----
If you are a Master’s student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECEN) department and have selected <em>Digital Systems</em? as your primary area of focus, it is required that you work with me to develop your Program of Study (PoS). You can download the PoS form [here](https://www.scu.edu/media/school-of-engineering/pdfs/graduate-engineering/ECEN-ENGINEERING-CORE-POS-FALL-2024.pdf).
Please create a draft version of your PoS and schedule an in-person meeting with me to review it. This will ensure that your plan aligns with your academic and career goals while meeting department requirements. When drafting your Program of Study, keep the following considerations in mind:
1. Graduate Core Requirements: You must take at least one course from the two graduate core areas (minimum 4 units). You can find the list of the coureses [here](https://www.scu.edu/bulletin/graduate/school-of-engineering/chapter-6-graduate-core-requirements-and-graduate-engineering.html#aca8c2afbf0e).
