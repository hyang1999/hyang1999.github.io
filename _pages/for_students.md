#SCU Undergraduate Students Interested in Summer Research
-----
SCU offers funding opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in summer research programs.
Please note that most funding applications for summer research are due in February during the Winter Quarter.
To determine your eligibility for these opportunities, visit the following pages:
* [Single Portal for Undergraduate Research](https://www.scu.edu/provost/research/student-funding-opportunities/scuspur/)
* [Kuehler Undergraduate Research](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/labs--research/research/kuehler-undergraduate-research/)

If you are eligible, I encourage you to contact me to discuss your interest in summer research **at least two weeks before the application deadline**.
Please keep in mind that there is typically a limit on the number of proposals each faculty member can submit.
Therefore, I will have to screen applicants based on their motivation and the specificity of their research ideas.



SCU Master’s Students Seeking Advice on Program of Study
-----
If you are a Master’s student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECEN) department and have selected <em>Digital Systems</em> as your primary area of focus, it is required that you work with me to develop your Program of Study (PoS). You can download the PoS form [here](https://www.scu.edu/media/school-of-engineering/pdfs/graduate-engineering/ECEN-ENGINEERING-CORE-POS-FALL-2024.pdf).
**Please create a draft version of your PoS and schedule an in-person meeting with me to review it.** This will ensure that your plan aligns with your academic and career goals while meeting department requirements. When drafting your Program of Study, keep the following considerations in mind:
1. Graduate Core Requirements: You must take at least one course from the two graduate core areas (minimum 4 units). You can find the list of the courses [here](https://www.scu.edu/bulletin/graduate/school-of-engineering/chapter-6-graduate-core-requirements-and-graduate-engineering.html#aca8c2afbf0e).
2. Applied Math (AMTH): You must earn at least 4 units. See the list of the AMTH courses [here](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-applied-mathematics/graduate/courses/).
3. Focus Area: You are required to select two additional breadth areas in addition to your primary area (<em>Digital Systems</em>). For each breadth area, you are not required to fulfill all the associated requirements; it is sufficient to select and complete at least one course from each area.
4. Additional Elective Courses: List any additional courses you wish to take beyond the ones selected above.
5. Transfer Credits: If you wish to transfer credits from your BS degree, complete this section. Please note that the credits that did not count towards your BS degree can only be transferred. If your BS degree was obtained from an institution other than SCU, make sure to bring your transcript when you come for advising.

Based on the sections completed above, you need to add up the units to create a plan to fulfill the 46-unit requirement. Further details can be discussed during an in-person meeting.

Students Interested in Applying to Master’s or Ph.D. Programs

Thank you for your interest. Due to the large number of applications I receive, I may not be able to respond to each inquiry individually. **Funded positions are available only when they are officially announced on my website.** If there is no such announcement and you do not receive a response from me after submitting an application, please consider it as an indication that I currently do not have funding available.
